# Python Practice Exercises

We are never fully trained and should therefore constantly challenge 
ourselves with old/new and simple/difficult tasks. Therefore I am 
starting this repository to improve my Python skills. 

The exercises were taken from:

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age. 
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they 
will turn 100 years old.

*Extras:*

1. Add on to the previous program by asking the user for another number 
and printing out that many copies of the previous message. 
(Hint: order of operations exists in Python)
2. Print out that many copies of the previous message on separate lines. 
(Hint: the string "\n is the same as pressing the ENTER button)
